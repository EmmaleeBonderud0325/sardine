abstract: |
    **Sardine** is a live coding environment and library for Python 3.10+ focusing on the modularity and extensibility of its base components (clocks, parser, *handlers*). Sardine has been designed to be easily integrated with existing *live-coding* environments as both a tool for experimentation and demonstration of various live coding techniques : temporal recursion, patterning, integration in various hardware and software setups. Although the tool is still in active early development, it has already been used in multiple public performances and algoraves. This paper is dedicated to the introduction of the **Sardine** system and the explanation of the main guidelines currently followed by contributors to the project. It will also present the preliminary results of our work through practical realizations that served as experimental validations during the early stages of development. Sardine already supports MIDI IN/Out, OSC IN/Out and *SuperCollider*/*SuperDirt* one-way communication through OSC.

# Introduction

Sardine is a live coding library based on Python 3.10+ focusing on modularity and extensibility of its base components. Despite still being in early alpha stage, Sardine is extensively documented on a [dedicated website](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr) providing installation guides, tutorials and media examples. Sardine is providing three main features linked together by the `FishBowl`, an environment handling synchronisation and communication between them:


- *a scheduling system* based on asynchronous and recursive function calls inspired by the concept of temporal recursion [@SorensenTemporal]. Calls can be scheduled in musical time either on an `InternalClock` or a `LinkClock` based on the Link Protocol [@goltz2018ableton].

- *a modular handlers* system allowing the creation and/or removal of various I/O (*OSC*, *MIDI*) or base components.

- *a small and tidy number based pattern programming language* with support for basic generative and musical syntax (MIDI notes, polyphony, etc...), time-based patterns (*clock* and *absolute* time), handling of symbolic names.


Sardine, by design, is in the direct lineage of previously released Python based libraries such as [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org) [@kirkbride2016foxdot], [Isobar](https://github.com/ideoforms/isobar) [@isobar] or the very recent [TidalVortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) [@vortex]. Initially conceived as a demonstration tool, Sardine partially emulates some selected features from the previously mentioned libraries or from the dominant live-coding *dialects* such as the [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) rhythmical mininotation [@mclean2014making] or the [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) imperative scheduling syntax [@aaron2016sonic]. Sardine is designed as a general *agnostic* framework for approaching live coding using Python. Thus, the library is aiming to support different writing paradigms and different approaches to live performance based on the manipulation of source code. The reliance on regular Python asynchronous functions for scheduling and music writing has for consequence that Sardine is particulary suited to let each developer-musician follow its own personal coding style, ensuring a blank slate for experimentation on live coding interface building. Furthermore, Sardine design has been strongly influenced by Andrew Mc Pherson's and Koray Tahiroğlu concerns about the *idiomatic patterns* [@mcpherson2020idiomatic] of usage enforced by computer music softwares, pushing users to repeat and strictly follow prefered patterns of usage. Sardine focuses on laying out the base infrastructure needed to support live coding in Python and wishes to encourage users to imagine diverse patterning idioms, diverse live coding targets, *mini-notations* or user-facing scheduling mechanisms and syntaxes. 

The version hereby presented -- labelled as `v0.2.0` -- is offering a first-look into the complete intended design for the library. It features a near complete rewrite over the `0.1.0` version previously used by members of the french live coding scene and by the first global Sardine users. It features two different clock implementations, multiple handlers for *I/O* (**MIDI**, **OSC**, **SuperDirt**), a robust asynchronous temporal recursive scheduling system and a reimagining of the *'Player'* system previously introduced by FoxDot[@kirkbride2016foxdot]. Sardine originality lies in its temporal model, strongly anchored in Python's default mechanisms for asynchronous programming. Sardine also features a modular overall architecture allowing it to be integrated in any live coding tooling and setup, capable of handling most Python-based scheduling duties or to be integrated in a larger mixed platform setup. It has been developped collectively with the help of John Phan based on user requests and feedback gathered during a first period of experimentation that saw Sardine being used or integrated by musicians for several algoraves, network-based jams and musical performances. 

Sardine has been developed entirely using the Python programming language, with few libraries depending on C++ code through bindings to external libraries. Despite the known short-comings of Python for interpreted conversational real time programming (incomplete support of dynamic programming, slowness relative to other interpreted languages), we do believe that this language is suitable for the implementation of a live coding library. The large collection of available librairies and modules and the popularity of the language ensures the affordance of good tooling and rich customization and integration options for different text editors, running environments, etc... Sardine already takes advantage of a thorough ecosystem of libraries focused on data *input*/*output*, network communication and text manipulation. Moreover, thanks to its lightweight and clear syntax, Python can be read by programmers coming from different domains with a minimal adaptation time, making it a convenient platform for collaboration and experimentation over the implementation of bespoke features needed by performers.

In the present article, we will introduce the **Sardine** system by detailing its goals (1) and base implementation centered on the scheduling mechanism (2), the environment/handler system (3) and the mininotation support (4). By doing so, we hope to highlight the basic principles of its inner working while providing some context on the current direction taken by the project and by its users.

# Methodology and objectives: a framework for exploring live-coding in Python

Sardine is born out of a curiosity for the implementation of similarly featured Python-based live-coding libraries such as [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org), [Isobar](https://github.com/ideoforms/isobar) or the very recent [TidalVortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) [@vortex]. At it inception, the Sardine project was thought as an attempt to provide a functional but barebones live coding library for demonstration purposes in a dissertation manuscript; a library capable enough for showing the impact of design and implementation choices on the possibilities of musical expression and on the expressiveness offered by a live coding environment. Therefore, a particular attention has been given to reproducing or *at least* paving the way for the reproduction of different coding styles and representation of timed musical information. Initial work for the `0.1.0` has been based upon an older personal attempt at writing a live coding library, then named *ComputerTalk*^[Some videos of this older system can be found on...]. The base design, unsuitable for the task, has quickly evolved after the first initial public tests. It has been decided to aim for an increased modularity of the system in order to support and maximise the *input* and *output* options offered by Sardine. This has allowed for the quick integration of the tool with other neighbor interfaces and live coding environments. 

The development of Sardine began initially in a period of frantic collaborations and joint performances with the parisian *Cookie Collective* [@cookiewebsite] and the Digital Audio Community from Lyon (*th4*, *ralt144MI*, etc..). Stemming from the *demoscene* and shader-coding scene, the *Cookie* is known for its complex multimedia performances, each member relying on bespoke hybrid audio-visual setups ranging from low end computing devices to complex synthesizers and circuit-bended video mixers. It is also known for working in an improvised manner, customising its setup for each venue depending on the audience needs and expectations. The need to adapt and customize the live coding interfaces already in use to the needs of each performance and each artist gave rise to the idea of creating a modular interface that could be used and mastered by all the members of the collective, while allowing for jam-ready synchronisation with other musicians and live-coders. The splitting of Foxdot's development into several competing branches reinforced the need for a customizable and easily editable Python interface by the community. Due to the open-ended nature of the development process, Sardine has been gradually shifting towards its current modular architecture, allowing each performer to refine the nature of the *inputs* and *outputs* controllable by the system, from simple MIDI note output to more convoluted custom Sysex and OSC message support. The invaluable help and expertise from John Phan has allowed for a complete deep rewrite of every base mechanism. The completion of the program rewrite marks the beginning of a new stage in the development process, focused on introducing new features (new audio backends? better OSC support?) and improving existing ones (parser?). This process is managed in an *ad-hoc* manner, by encouraging users to propose ideas and contribute to an extensively documented codebase.

# Sardine implementation

\end{center}


Sardine is implemented and distributed as two complementary Python modules: `sardine` and `fishery`. They work hand in hand in a layered and coordinated fashion. `fishery` provides amendments to the default Python asynchronous REPL^[*Read, Eval, Print, Loop*: mechanism used by most interpreted languages to quickly process user input from the command line.] and constitutes the entry point for the Sardine system, accessible by typing `python -m fishery` or simply `fishery` right after install. `fishery` is nothing more but a slightly modified version of the base Python asynchronous REPL. Importing it also imports `sardine` and will *de facto* starting a new playing session. As an helper for new users, a terminal based configuration client (`sardine-config`) is also provided and can be used to setup various options before starting `fishery`. Configuration files are stored in a default standard location depending on the OS currently in use (`e.g.` `.local/share` on UNIX systems). Configuration files include a general JSON configuration file, a `.py` file usable to load user-specifc Python code at the start of each session and files needed to properly configure a *SuperCollider*/*SuperDirt* session. This architecture, despite its initial complexity, is being used to make Sardine more accessible to novice users who may not be familiar with using the command line and Python development tools. Files relative to Sardine will be kept in a single configuration folder. Note that modularity of the system is greatly encouraged, with many *input* and *output* components being disabled by default. This makes the installation of any audio-backend like SuperCollider entirely optional, being considered more as a target than a dependency.

Thanks to the generally great IDE support for Python, *Sardine* is not shipping with its own text-editor or dedicated text editor plugin. Sardine has been tested with third-party code writing tools such as *Atom*, *VSCode*, *Emacs*, *Vim/Neovim* or even *Jupyter Notebooks*. Each one of these text editors generally support the spawning of an asynchronous REPL and the piping of code from a text buffer to a running interpreter. The setup process for each one of these interfaces generally relies on the installation of a simple general-purpose Python plugin^[The process for setting up various interfaces is extensively detailed on [Sardine Website](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr)]. This state of fact has lead us to consider the Python interpreter as a code receiver and monitoring tool mainly used to mirror useful information to the user, such as the state of the SuperCollider sub-process, of the event loop and *runners*, etc... Every other operation is directly handled by calls internal to a Sardine session.

Reliance on any audio backend can / will require the boot of another application. For the time being, only *SuperCollider* and *SuperDirt* are natively supported by their own Sardine components. Even though the installation of these backends is still necessary for users willing to use them, integration is done in such a way that there is no need -- later on -- to actively take care and monitor manually any of these dependencies. A basic API to *SuperCollider* and *SuperDirt* is offered through the `SC.send()` function, allowing to run arbitrary `sclang` code in the subprocess session. The addition of more automatically-managed audio-backend *subprocesses* is actively planned and will be explored in the coming months (deeper *SuperCollider* integration, *CSound* backend, etc...). Clever combination of Sardine provided functions is already allowing some amount of customization for patterning hardware and software synthesizers through MIDI or OSC.

Being packaged as a regular Python module, Sardine makes use of the `pyproject.toml` module configuration and packaging format defined by PEP 660. This has for advantages that no third party tool is currently required to install Sardine other than a base *complete* installation of a modern (3.10+) Python runtime. However, one must note that the package is not, at the time of writing, fully installable in the binary *'wheels'* format generally favored by Python developers and users alike. This has to do with the problematic packaging of some C++ external dependencies used by Sardine to process various I/O processes. Future versions will hopefully be tighly packaged and served through the central *Pipy* package distribution system. Most users will still have to install part of the compilation toolchain (`CMake` and any compatible C++ compiler) to be able to manually compile these dependencies for the target system.

## Event loop and scheduling System

As a framework aiming to support various forms of live coding in Python, Sardine is offering to its users a generic low-level mechanism handling the scheduling and the unraveling of temporal events. Sardine blends the concept of a musical clock, a design pattern common to many music programming libraries, with the event loop natively supported by Python through its `asyncio` library. 

### Event loop

![*Event Loop Diagram*](images/event_loop.png){width=100%}\`
\begin{center}
\textbf{Figure 2:} \textit{Architecture diagram of the customised asynchronous event loop.}
\end{center}


Sardine is making use of the asynchronous programming features offered by Python. More specifically, Sardine takes advantage of the not well known `asyncio` REPL prototype introduced by Python 3.8 [@asynciorepl]. The UVLoop [@uvloop] drop-in replacement event loop is also being used in order to speed up the scheduling of asynchronous calls. Several hot-patches to the asynchronous loop have been introduced by John Phan (*thegamecracks*) in order to make its behaviour consistent on every major OS platform. Sardine is laid out as a series of abstractions built on the base loop, making it aware of tempo and timing. Sardine *clock* (either the `internal` or `link`) clock automatically starts whenever the system is imported but pure asynchronous calls can still be handled even if the clock is being stopped.

The consistency of the asynchronous clocks is being covered by tests (in the `tests/` folder) and has been checked to be *on-par* with the alternatives offered by similar more widely used threaded clocks. Development of such a feature has proven to be a difficult technical challenge due to the specificity of the task and of the relatively obscure inner workings of internal OS's schedulers. Threaded components are still used for various *I/O* operations in order to lighten the load of the event loop and to alleviate the temporal cost of message processing. Note that many *Sardine* components are entirely optional and can be activated on demand by the user. Only the `clock`, `AsyncRunners` and `SleepHandler` constitute the core abstractions needed over Python `asyncio` loop. Basing the custom event loop on top of the Python asynchronous interpreter is allowing for the evaluation of any top-level asynchronous `await` instructions that would be forbidden by the main interpreter. It must be noted that Python `asyncio` features have their own logic for every major OS and that some differences can be noted when testing under different systems.

### Scheduling

\Begin{multicols}{2}

![*Lifetime of an asynchronous 'swimming' function*](images/asyncrunner_diagram.png){width=51%}\ 
\begin{center}

\end{center}

Python is known to be a language that doesn't have native support for tail-call recursion [@guido1;@guido2], making the infinite recursion of a function a delicate task. To properly support this central feature, a complex system based on John Phan's `AsyncRunners` has been developed and is used as the basis for every repetitive operation (such as a pattern) scheduled with Sardine. In the spirit of the metaphor followed by the whole program, a temporal recursive function is called by the development team a *swimming function*, and is labelled in code as an `AsyncRunner`. A *swimming function* can be started using the `@swim` decorator^[Decorators in Python are used to add a behaviour to an object without modifying the base object itself.], stopped using the `@die` decorator and can receive updates all along its lifetime on the scheduler.

Decorating a Python function is enough to push a given synchronous or asynchronous function to the scheduler, making it repeat every `p` (for `period`), a time measured in beats relative to the clock currently in use. The content of a given function will be re-evaluated for every recursion cycle and state can be preserved either by passing arguments to a subsequent call or by relying on global state. *Swimming functions* are a powerful construct for building abstractions dealing with time, code re-evaluation and dynamic lifetime management of code components. Iterators, for example, can be built by incrementing a variable passed as argument. Random generators can be built by calling a simple native random function whose result will be dynamically updated for each recursion.

\End{multicols}

*Swimming functions* will automatically start *on-the-beat*. The start of a function can target a specific point in musical time by specifying a special `snap` argument that is understood as an offset, in beats, from the beginning of the next bar. The `period` argument of a given function is the only required argument for a function to be considered as a valid *swimming function*. Every other component of the *Sardine* system works on the assumption that its evaluation context will be the *swimming function*. They can receive any arbitrary Python code and/or call the various players defined by the Sardine system to properly handle *I/O* operations. Thus, the prototype of a basic musical function using the base model looks like:

~~~~ {.python}
@swim # swimming decorator (swim or die)
def swimming_function(p=0.5, i=0): # p: (period), i (custom iterator)
    print('I am swimming in time.')
    D('bd, hh, cp, hh', i=i) # call to the 'Dirt' SuperDirt interface.
    ... # user specified code
    again(swimming_function, p=0.5, i=i+1) # recursion callback with argument passing
    # remove the call to again() to stop the recursion from happening, stopping the runner.
~~~~
\begin{center}
\textbf{Figure 4:} \textit{A commented complete example of a 'swimming' recursive function.}
\end{center}


Multiple abstractions can be built on top of the basic *swimming function* mechanism, allowing for a terser user-facing syntax. We believe that building abstraction on top of the *swimming function* is helpful to allow newcomers to get a grasp on the temporal model offered by the system. The FoxDot's inspired *surfboard* mechanism is currently the only abstraction available demonstrating this principle. It automatically handles its own scheduling logic and provides its own iterators needed by the default parser. It also provides additional musical logic without the need of altering the base scheduling logic, thus adding a completely new -- and optional -- flavour of patterning/scheduling for Sardine users. Following this model, Sardine future versions are likely to include user-based modes of playing built upon the basic abstractions provided by the library.

Pa >> d('bd, hh, cp, hh', p=0.5) # Terser version of the above swimming function

## Environment, dispatch and handlers

### The FishBowl

While the scheduling takes an important part in the overall modular design of the Sardine library, its logic wouldn't function without the central piece of the system called the *'FishBowl'*. The *'FishBowl'* is an environment for software components handling the synchronisation and coordination between all the different pieces composing a Sardine system. This environment has been designed so that every component of the system can talk or access transparently and instantly to the data held by any other component. The *'FishBowl'* is a central coordination mechanism allowing components to subscribe to it throuh *hooks* and to react to every message `dispatch`ed through it. The `bowl.dispatch('stop')` message is an example of an important message -- stopping the clock -- asking for the collaboration and immediate response of multiple components. Naturally, some components are more important than others and can thus be considered as *hard* dependencies. Other *soft* dependencies, mainly the various *I/O* handlers available, can be added and removed from the environment/session at any point in time. The `clock` and the `parser` are two *hard* dependencies that cannot be removed but can be swapped. They provide the basic mechanisms needed by every other modular component to properly function. The fluidity of the *FishBowl* mechanism allows for the addition and removal of modular logic to any Sardine system, capable of answering to any message currently being dispatched to neighbor components. One can switch from the `internal` to the `link` clock *on-the-fly* if needed to synchronise with other players, or add a new OSC receiver. The parser can also be switched, even though the current version of Sardine does not feature multiple parsers.

~~~~ {.python}
bowl = FishBowl(clock=clock(tempo=config.bpm, bpb=config.beats)) # declaring the bowl
...
midi = MidiHandler(port_name=str(config.midi))                   # instance of new component
bowl.add_handler(midi)                                           # adding to the environment
M = midi.send                                                    # aliasing for playability
~~~~
\begin{center}
\textbf{Figure 6:} \textit{Excerpt from Sardine boot process, addition of a MIDI Output.}
\end{center}

### Component example: the MIDI sender

In the preceding figure, a MIDI handler was added to the *'FishBowl'*, thus giving access to a new MIDI output. *Senders* are one example of a Sardine modular components needing the collaboration of multiple parts of the system to function properly. The `M` (`midi.send`) function serves as the central output for this component. It represents the only function that the user will be playing with during a session. It needs, to operate efficiently, an access to the `parser` for patterning and composing a valid message, to the `clock` for sending its message in musical time and to the `SleepHandler` to precisely time calls between a 'note on' and 'note off' message. By declaring itself to the environment, it gained access to these much needed features that will be accessed transparenlty without having to deal with the innermost lower-level logic. By consequence, user interaction can be carefully implemented through one minimal function only, letting the system handle the hard and slightly convoluted asynchronous scheduling calls take place in the background.


~~~~ {.python}
# basic MIDI note scheduling (duration handled by bowl.SleepHandler)
M(note=60, velocity=100, channel=0, dur=0.25)                        
# patterning a similar call with added component-specific logic (strings parsed by bowl.parser)
M(note='C@penta, C.., G3', velocity='80~100', channel='[0:10]', i=i, r=2) 
~~~~
\begin{center}
\textbf{Figure 7:} \textit{Sending MIDI using multiple components of the bowl.}
\end{center}

Similar *senders* or *handlers* can be implemented for various operations needing collaboration between multiple parts of the system. Given that each of these adhere to the `BaseHandler`, abstract base class, adding a component to Sardine does not require any particulary complex addition or refactoring to the base system.

## Sardine Pattern Language

A small patterning language has been developed for **Sardine** using the [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) parsing toolkit. Defined as a LALR parser, the syntax of the language is best described as a list-based calculator capable of dealing with basic MIDI note definition, custom chance operators and other composition tools.
