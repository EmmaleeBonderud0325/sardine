# Basics

This is a reference for the main components used with Sardine. When you are learning, you won't need to understand everything in each page. But later, these pages will be the go-to source for how things works and what syntax to use. 

Some sections cover concepts like temporal recursion. We try to keep the technical jargon to a minimum but sometimes it's important to understand more about how Sardine works. 

Components and features covered in Basics:
- **Senders**: syntax options for samples, MIDI, Ziffers, etc in both Play and @swim functions. 
- **Players**: shorthand syntax and the most basic way to create patterns. 
- **@swim functions**: the fundamental mechanism for organizing patterns.
- **Iterators**: used in @swim functions to manage changing values. 
- **Period, Divisor, Rate:** used for controlling rhythm and repetition.
- **Tempo and playback control**
