# About

## Why Sardine?

**Sardine** is a *side-project* initially conceived as a demonstration tool made for my *PhD dissertation* in musicology at the University of Saint-Etienne / Paris 8 University. **Sardine** is trying to encompass various programming paradigms and techniques used by live coders: declarative and imperative programming, DSLs for pattern processing, clock synchronisation with other tools, live cybernetic performances, etc...

Obviously, I'm also trying to develop **Sardine** for my own usage and for my friends. Programming new tools is fun and rewarding! I am playing music with the [Cookie Collective](https://cookie.paris/) in Paris and with the Creative Code Lyon community. I am a member of [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org/) and documentation contributor to [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/).

I learned programming by live coding music. The next logical step is now to code my own tool so I can share it with others and make people see the incredibly fruitful intersection between code and music.  Since I started live coding a few years ago, I always wished to develop my own tool just to see how things work!

##Â Contributions

Contributions of any sort are really welcome! I am not a professional developer and am just trying to do my best with Sardine! I might code things in a weird / unefficient way. Everything takes place on the main GitHub repo, website and Python package. Don't be afraid of proposing big breaking changes, I'm here for the fun!
