# What is Sardine?

![img](what_is_sardine.png)

Sardine is a **Python based musical instrument**. While it may look like a typical Python library, it is best described as a modular live coding environment. You won&rsquo;t just **import** it and forget it, you will play it like a guitar or a trombone. **Sardine** will allow you to sequence synthesizers, audio samples and various messages used by software or hardware audio/video equipment. **Sardine** is leveraging **Python** as a way to build powerful and terse algorithmic sequences that you can type fast while on stage. **Sardine** is also embedding multiple small languages (the more the merrier!) allowing you to do that even faster, and with style!

**Sardine** is using **Python** for its flexibility. **Python** is a very popular programming language for a good reason. It has a lot of different packages and it is very well supported pretty much everywhere :) You won&rsquo;t have any problem finding a good text editor or finding the right tools for the job.

A small community of musicians and artists in France (and even elsewhere) are using **Sardine**. You can find more by looking at the showcase section or by getting in touch with other **Sardine users** on social medias: **Discord**, etc&#x2026;
