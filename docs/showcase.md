Sardine is used by musicians and artists to create algorithmic art by manipulating and re-evaluating source code *on-the-fly*. As an ongoing research project, Sardine is always on the move! Its users are adapting, refining and customizing Sardine for various purposes:

- controlling hardware synthesizers (Rack Units, Eurorack).

- sampling / synthesis and audio mangling.

- sending and receiving OSC from the local network to control a performance setup.

- running GUI loops for physical simulations and other weird experiments :)

##Â Legacy footage

These examples have been recorded during the initial early stages of Sardine development. I grew fond of them as they show where it all started and highlight how the project has evolved since that time. Sardine grew out of an old system called **ComputerTalk** that I never released.
