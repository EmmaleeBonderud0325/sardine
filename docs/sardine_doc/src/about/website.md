# About this website

This website is generated using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and its deployment is automated. Every commit on the `main` branch of the [Sardine repository](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/sardine) will trigger a rebuild. This website is a collective effort. You can contribute by amending or adding new [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and linking them in the `SUMMARY.md` file.

Building good documentation is hard. If you want to make it better, you are very welcome to do it and I will accept your changes most of the time :)
