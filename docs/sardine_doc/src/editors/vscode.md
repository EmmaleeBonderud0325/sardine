[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful and all-devouring code editor developed by ****Microsoft****. It is the most widely spread code editor out there with millions of users, thousands of plugins and corporate support. **VSCode** is more than capable of handling **Sardine** sessions and there are multiple ways to configure everything for it.

-   Install the Python support for VSCode using the lateral menu. It might be the first package they will propose you given the popularity of Python!
-   Open up a new terminal using the `Create new Terminal in the Active Workspace` command (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P and search `>`).
-   Type `fishery` and press enter to start a new session.
-   Use `Shift + Enter` to send code to the terminal session.

This is a simple yet effective way of using **Sardine** while retaining all the power of **VSCode** at your fingertips!
