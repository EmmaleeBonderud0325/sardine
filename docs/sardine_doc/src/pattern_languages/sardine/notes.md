# Notes

## What are notes?

Notes are numbers written using a conjunction of letters and numbers.
- Notes will always be converted to some MIDI value 
  - an integer value between `0` and `127`).
- If you need more precision, speak in hertzs (`freq=402.230239`)

```python
@swim
def notes(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('pluck', midinote='C5 D5 E5 F5 G5', i=i)
    again(notes, p=0.5, i=i+1)
```

## Writing a note

The syntax to write notes is the following:
- A capital letter indicating the note name: `C D E F G A B`.
  - Optionally, you can write `Do RÃ© Mi Fa Sol La Si` (french note system).
- An optional flat or sharp: `#`, `b`.
- An optional octave number: `0..9`.

Notes are letters turned to numbers. **You can do mathematics and calculations with notes**. It can be particularly useful to generate custom voicings or weirdly shaped chords that you want to transpose and invert around: `{([0 4 7 9 10 11]+50)^1}`.

## Note qualifiers

You can use the `@` operator to **qualify** a note. 
- A note will become a collection of notes based on the initial note.
  - `C@penta` will yield a major pentatonic scale based on C4: `[60 62 64 67 69]`.

```python
@swim
def notes(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('pluck', n='C5@penta', i=i)
    again(notes, p=0.5, i=i+1)
```

**Be careful with this rule!** This will instantly turn a single token into a list of `x` tokens:
- filter part of your newly generated collection for better control (`(filt)` or `(quant)`)


To put it bluntly, this mechanism is not great. It was introduced in the alpha version of
Sardine as a way to play notes and it sticked! To play chords and harmonies, prefer the 
**Ziffers** patterning language that is included with Sardine.

## Collection or Chord inversions


You can write chord/sequence inversions using the `^` syntax
- The right hand side of the expression accept any number: `^(1~5)`. 
  - You can also feed negative numbers for inverting a chord downwards.
- Chord inversions work on anything that is a list. Write custom chords!

```python
@swim
def notes(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('pluck', midinote='(disco C5@maj7^(0~4))', i=i)
    again(notes, p=0.5, i=i+1)
``` 

## Polyphony

### Note polyphony


    
- You can use the `{` and `}` delimiters to make parts of your pattern polyphonic.
  - There is **note polyphony**, aka when multiple notes are played together.
  - There is **parametric polyphonic**, aka when the same event is played multiple times with different parameters.
    
```python
@swim
def poly(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('superpiano', 
        cutoff=500,
        midinote='{D@maj9} {G@maj7^0} {D@maj9} {G@dim7^1}',
        i=i, d=2, r=0.25
    )
    again(poly, p=P('0.5!4 0.25!2', i), i=i+1)
```

There a few rules to understand about polyphony and polyphonic messages. These rules can sound quite counter-intuitive if you think about polyphony just like you think of it on a musical score.
    - The **size** of a polyphonic event &#x2013; meaning the number of messages sent for one occurence of an event &#x2013; is equal to the length of the largest polyphonic pattern you declared.
    
In the first example, we have a 4-5 note polyphony. Every polyphonic element from our pattern is a major 9 or 7 chord (*e.g* `[62, 66, 69, 73, 76]`). It means that if you have a polyphony of `2` somewhere and a polyphony of `4` elsewhere, your first polyphony will be distributed over the second one:
    
    PATTERN:
    
    1.  [1 2 3 4]
    2.  [0 1]
    
    RESULT (POLYPHONY):
    
    1.  [1 2 3 4]
    2.  [0 1 0 1]
    
To illustrate the preceding rule we just talked about, here is a truly bizarre example. Half of our chord is played by a tuned bassdrum, the other half by a piano. Even though this may look odd, this is fully compliant with how parameters are handled by **Sardine**.
    
```python
@swim
def poly(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('{[bd  superpiano]}', cutoff=500, midinote='{D@maj9} {G@maj7^0} {D@maj9} {G@dim7^1}', i=i, d=2, r=0.25)
    again(poly, p=Pat('0.5!4 0.25!2', i), i=i+1)
```   

We have two clear alternations, one between the `superpiano` and `bd` sound sets, the other between the four or five values that form our chords. It is then natural that half of our polyphony will be composed from a tuned bassdrum and the remaining half from a tuned piano. Once you get use to this novel way of thinking about polyphonic patterns, you will see that it opens up some space for interesting polyphonic interactions between sounds :)
It is currently not possible to limit the number of voices generated by an event. Be careful! It is quite easy to get overrun and to kill your computer playing with polyphony!

# Parametric polyphony

Everything can become polyphonic. Just wrap anything between `{` and `}` and you will return the same event piled up multiple times with different parameters. It allows you to be very creative with patterns.

```python
@swim
def poly(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('drum:[1 6]', speed='{[1 rand]} {[2 1.9]}', i=i, d=3)
    D('drum:2', cutoff='{[[500:2000,100] 500]}', i=i, d=2)
    D('bd', shape=0.5, i=i, d=4)
    again(poly, p=0.5/2, i=i+1)
```
