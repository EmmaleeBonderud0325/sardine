# Variable Functions

This set of functions is handling all the variables available in the **Sardine Pattern Language**. You will find functions used to set the value or get the value of **amphibian variables**, **internal variables** and also some other important variables such as the currently selected global scale. 

# set (s)

Assign a variable to a name in a global namespace shared by all the SPL expressions. The variable can be anything: a number, a name, a list, etc... The function also returns the value, allowing it to be re-used immediately for the current pattern. This function is of **paramount importance**. You can use it to write reactive patterns, where multiple patterns share the same data.

**Arguments:**
- **name:** variable name. Can be any valid name.
- **value:** a single value (int, float, name, list).

**Example:**
```python
# Change (set a ...) to update multiple patterns at once
Pa * d('kick', speed='(set imp [1 3 4 9 2 4])') # Setting some numbers in the variable "imp"
Pb * d('hat:(get imp)', speed='(get imp)')      # Getting these numbers in many other patterns
```

# get (g)

Get a variable associated to a name. This function is the second part of the *get*/*set* mechanism. You can retrieve any value currently associated to a name. If no name-value is found for that name, the value `0` will be returned in an attempt to prevent crashes.

**Arguments:**
- **name:** variable name.

**Example:**
```python
Pz * d('clap', room='(get roomy)', crush='(get globalcrush)')
```

# setscl

The **Sardine Pattern Language** always remember the name of a global scale that the user can set. It defaults toÂ `major`, taken from the [list of possible qualifiers](../sardine/notes.md). You can choose any scale from that list as the default scale for all patterns using **scl**, thus the name of this very function.

**Arguments:**
- **scale_name:** valid scale from the [qualifiers list](../sardine/notes.md). If the name doesn't exist, will default to major.

**Example:**
```python
P('(setscl minor)')
P('(setscl acoustic)')
P('(setscl min9)')
```
