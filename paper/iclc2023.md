abstract: |
    **Sardine** is a live coding environment and library for Python 3.10+ focusing on the modularity and extensibility of its base components (clocks, parser, *handlers*). Sardine has been designed to be easily integrated with existing *live-coding* environments as both a tool for experimentation and demonstration of various live coding techniques : temporal recursion, patterning, integration in various hardware and software setups. Although the tool is still in active early development, it has already been used in multiple public performances and algoraves. This paper is dedicated to the introduction of the **Sardine** system and the explanation of the main guidelines currently followed by contributors to the project. It will also present the preliminary results of our work through practical realizations that served as experimental validations during the early stages of development. Sardine already supports MIDI IN/Out, OSC IN/Out and *SuperCollider*/*SuperDirt* one-way communication through OSC.

# Introduction

Sardine is a live coding library based on Python 3.10+ focusing on modularity and extensibility of its base components. Despite still being in early alpha stage, Sardine is extensively documented on a [dedicated website](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr) providing installation guides, tutorials and media examples. Sardine is providing three main features linked together by the `FishBowl`, an environment handling synchronisation and communication between them:


- *a scheduling system* based on asynchronous and recursive function calls inspired by the concept of temporal recursion [@SorensenTemporal]. Calls can be scheduled in musical time either on an `InternalClock` or a `LinkClock` based on the Link Protocol [@goltz2018ableton].

- *a small and tidy number based pattern programming language* with support for basic generative and musical syntax (MIDI notes, polyphony, etc...), time-based patterns (*clock* and *absolute* time), handling of symbolic names.

- *a modular handlers* system allowing the creation and/or removal of various I/O (*OSC*, *MIDI*) or base components.

Sardine, by design, is in the direct lineage of previously released Python based libraries such as [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org) [@kirkbride2016foxdot], [Isobar](https://github.com/ideoforms/isobar) [@isobar] or the very recent [TidalVortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) [@vortex]. Initially conceived as a demonstration tool, Sardine partially emulates some selected features from the previously mentioned libraries or from the dominant live-coding *dialects* such as the [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) [@mclean2014making] rhythmical mininotation or the [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) [@aaron2016sonic] imperative writing syntax. Sardine is designed as a general *agnostic* framework for approaching live coding using Python. Thus, the library is aiming to support different writing paradigms and different approaches to live performance based on the manipulation of source code. The reliance on regular Python asynchronous functions for scheduling and music writing has for consequence that Sardine is particulary suited to let each developer-musician follow its own personal coding style, ensuring a blank slate for experimentation. Furthermore, Sardine design has been strongly influenced by Andrew Mc Pherson's and Koray Tahiroğlu concerns about the *idiomatic patterns* [@mcpherson2020idiomatic] of usage enforced by computer music softwares, pushing users to repeat and strictly follow prefered patterns of usage.

The version hereby presented, labelled as `0.2.0`, is offering a first-look into the complete intended design for the library. It features a near complete rewrite over the `0.1.0` version previously used by members of the french live coding scene and by the first global Sardine users. It features two clocks, one capable of network synchronisation, multiple handlers for MIDI, OSC and SuperDirt *input* and *output*, a robust asynchronous temporal recursive scheduling system and a reimagining of the *'Player'* system previously introduced by FoxDot[@kirkbride2016foxdot]. Sardine originality lies in its temporal model, strongly anchored in Python's default mechanisms for asynchronous programming -- the `asyncio` library -- offering a variant to other threaded musical clocks offered by past Python based live coding libraries. It also presents itself as an *agnostic* and minimal tool modular enough to be integrated into any live-coder tooling and setup, capable of handling very general MIDI, OSC or Python-based scheduling duties. As such, Sardine has been already successfully integrated in various laptop-based performance setups involving audio, video and hardware components.

On the technical side, Sardine has been developed entirely using the Python programming language, with few libraries depending on C++ code through bindings to external libraries. Despite the known short-comings of Python for interpreted conversational real time programming (incomplete support of dynamic programming, slowness relative to other interpreted languages), we do believe that this language is suitable for the implementation of a live coding library. The large collection of available librairies and modules and the popularity of the language ensures the affordance of good tooling and rich customization and Sardine integration options into different text editors, running environments, etc... Sardine already takes advantage of a thorough ecosystem of libraries focused on data *input*/*output*, network communication and text manipulation. Moreover, thanks to its lightweight and clear syntax, Python can be read by programmers coming from different domains with a minimal adaptation time, making it a convenient platform for collaboration and experimentation over the implementation of bespoke features needed by performers.

# Methodology and objectives: a framework for exploring live-coding in Python

Sardine is born out of a curiosity for the inner workings of similarly featured Python-based live-coding libraries such as [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org), [Isobar](https://github.com/ideoforms/isobar) or the very recent [TidalVortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) [@vortex]. At it inception, the Sardine project was thought as an attempt to provide a functional but barebones live coding library for demonstration purposes in a dissertation manuscript; a library capable enough for showing the impact of design and implementation choices on the possibilities of musical expression and on the expressiveness offered by a live coding environment. Therefore, a particular attention has been given to reproducing or *at least* paving the way for the reproduction of different coding styles and representation of timed musical information. Base design has quickly evolved, after the first initial tests to increase the general modularity of the system. This has been done in order to easily support and maximise the *input*/*output* options handled by Sardine, allowing to quickly integrate it with other interfaces and live coding environments.

The development of Sardine began initially in a period of collaboration and joint performances with the parisian *Cookie Collective* [@cookiewebsite] and the Digital Audio Community from Lyon (*th4*, *ralt144MI*, etc..). Stemming from the *demoscene* and shader-coding scene, the *Cookie* is known for its complex multimedia performances, each member relying on bespoke hybrid audio-visual setups, ranging from low end computing devices to complex synthesizers and circuit-bended video mixers. The need to adapt and customize the live coding interfaces already in use to the needs of each performance and each artist gave rise to the idea of creating a modular interface that could be used and mastered by all the members of the collective, while allowing for jam-ready synchronisation with other musicians and live-coders. The splitting of Foxdot's development into several competing branches reinforced the need for a customizable and easily editable Python interface by the community. Due to the open-ended nature of the development process, Sardine has been gradually shifting towards its current modular architecture, allowing each performer to refine the nature of the *inputs* and *outputs* controllable by the system, from simple MIDI note output to more convoluted custom Sysex messages support. The invaluable help and expertise from John Phan has allowed for a complete deep rewrite of every base mechanism.

# Sardine implementation

Sardine is implemented and distributed as two complementary Python modules: `sardine` and `fishery`. They work hand in hand in a layered and coordinated fashion. `fishery` provides amendments to the default Python asynchronous REPL^[*Read, Eval, Print, Loop*: mechanism used by most interpreted languages to quickly process user input from the command line.] and constitutes the entry point for the Sardine system, accessible by typing `python -m fishery` right after install. `fishery` is nothing more but a slightly modified version of the base Python asynchronous REPL. Importing it also imports `sardine` and will *de facto* starting a new playing session. The *SuperCollider* and *SuperDirt* boot process can also be directly managed by Sardine, providing a basic but functional API to the SuperCollider *sclang* interpreter. As an helper for new users, a terminal based configuration client (`sardine-config`) is also provided  and can be used to setup various options of the system before the start of a session. Configuration files are stored in a default standard location depending on the OS currently in use. This architecture, despite being slightly complex for non-initiated developers, is being used to make Sardine more accessible to novice users who may not be familiar with using the command line and Python development tools. The modularity of the system makes the installation of an audio-backend like SuperCollider entirely optional, being a target more than a dependency.

Being packaged as a regular Python module, Sardine makes use of the `pyproject.toml` module configuration and packaging format defined by PEP 660. This has for advantages that no third party tool is currently required to install Sardine other than a base *complete* installation of a modern (3.10+) Python runtime. However, one must note that the package is not, at the time of writing, fully installable in the binary *'wheels'* format generally favored by Python developers and users alike. This has to do with the problematic packaging of some C++ external dependencies used by Sardine to process various I/O processes. Future versions will hopefully be tighly packaged and served through the central 'Pipy' package distribution system. Most users will still have to install part of the compilation toolchain (`CMake` and any compatiblee C++ compiler) to be able to manually compile these dependencies for the target system.

Thanks to the generally great IDE support for Python, *Sardine* is not shipping with its own text-editor. It preferably relies on third-party tools such as *Atom*, *VSCode*, *Emacs*, *Vim* or even *Jupyter Notebooks*. Each one of these text editors generally support the piping of code from a text buffer to an attached REPL with the installation of a simple general-purpose Python plugin. This turns the Python interpreter into a monitoring tool and message receiver used mainly to print useful informations to the user.

## Event loop and scheduling System

### Event loop

\Begin{multicols}{2}

![*Event Loop Diagram*](images/event_loop_diagram.png){width=49%}\ 

Sardine is making use of the asynchronous programming features offered by Python. More specifically, Sardine takes advantage of the not well known `asyncio` REPL prototype introduced by Python 3.8 [@asynciorepl]. The UVLoop [@uvloop] drop-in replacement event loop is also being used in order to speed up the scheduling of asynchronous calls. Several hot-patches to the asynchronous loop have been introduced by John Phan (*thegamecracks*) in order to make its behaviour consistent on every major OS platform. Sardine is laid out as a series of abstractions built on the `asyncio` event loop, making it aware of tempo and timing. Sardine *clock* (either the `internal` or `link`) clock automatically starts whenever the system is imported but pure asynchronous calls can still be handled even if the clock is being stopped, paused or switched.

\End{multicols}

The consistency of the asynchronous clocks is being covered by tests (in the `tests/` folder) and has been checked to be *on-par* with the alternatives offered by other more widely used threaded clocks. Development of such a feature has proven to be a difficult technical challenge due to the specificity of the task and of the relatively obscure inner workings of internal OS's schedulers. Threaded components are still used for various *I/O* operations in order to lighten the load of the event loop and to alleviate the temporal cost of message processing. Note that many *Sardine* components are entirely optional and can be activated on demand by the user. Only the `clock`, `AsyncRunners` and `SleepHandler` constitute the core abstractions needed over Python `asyncio` loop.


### Scheduling

\Begin{multicols}{2}

![*Lifetime of an asynchronous 'swimming' function*](images/asyncrunner_diagram.png){width=50%}\ 

Python is known for not supporting tail-call recursion [@guido1;@guido2], making the infinite recursion of a function a delicate task. To properly support this central feature, a complex system based on John Phan's `AsyncRunners` has been developed and is used as the basis for every repetitive operation (such as a pattern) scheduled with Sardine. In the spirit of the metaphor followed by the whole program, a temporal recursive function is called by the development team a *swimming function*, and is labelled in code as an `AsyncRunner`. A *swimming function* can be started using the `@swim` decorator^[Decorators in Python are used to add a behaviour to an object without modifying the base object itself.], stopped using the `@die` decorator and can receive updates all along its lifetime on the scheduler.

Decorating a Python function is enough to push a given synchronous or asynchronous function to the scheduler, making it repeat every `p` (for `period`), a time measured in beats relative to the clock currently in use. The content of a given function will be re-evaluated for every recursion cycle and state can be preserved either by passing arguments to a subsequent call or by relying on global state. *Swimming functions* are a powerful construct for building abstractions dealing with time, code re-evaluation and dynamic lifetime management of code components. For instance, iterators can be built by incrementing a variable passed as argument.

\End{multicols}

Every other component of the *Sardine* system works on the assumption that its evaluation context will be the *swimming function*. *Swimming functions* can receive any arbitrary Python code and/or call the various players defined by the Sardine system to properly handle *I/O* operations. Thus, a complete prototype player function using the base model looks like:

~~~~ {.python}
@swim # swimming decorator (swim or die): pushing to the scheduler
def swimming_function(p=0.5, i=0): # p (period), i (custom iterator)
    print('I am swimming in time.')
    D('bd, hh, cp, hh', i=i) # call to the 'Dirt' SuperDirt interface.
    ... # calls and logic
    again(swimming_function, p=0.5, i=i+1) # recursion callback with argument passing
~~~~

Abstractions can be built on top of the basic *swimming function* mechanism, allowing for a terser user-facing syntax. We believe that building abstraction on top of the *swimming function* is helpful to allow newcomers to get a grasp on the temporal model offered by the system. The FoxDot's inspired *surfboard* mechanism is currently the only abstraction available demonstrating this principle. It automatically handles its own scheduling logic and also provides iterators needed by the *Senders* that we will detail later on:


~~~~ {.python}
Pa >> d('bd, hh, cp, hh', p=0.5) # Terser version of the above swimming function
~~~~

Every component of the system can talk or access the data held by any other component through the central *'FishBowl'* mechanism. It has been implemented as a message dispatcher, allowing each component to subscribe to the environment throuh *hooks*.

## Sardine Pattern Language

A small patterning language has been developed for **Sardine** using the [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) parsing toolkit. Defined as a LALR parser, the syntax of the language is best described as a list-based calculator capable of dealing with basic MIDI note definition, custom chance operators and other composition tools.
