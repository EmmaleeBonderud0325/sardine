# TidalCycles (Vortex)

[Vortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex) is an experimental Python port of [TidalCycles](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal) that was initially started by Alex McLean, Sylvain Le Beux, Silvani Damián and Raphaël Maurice Forment (
[conference paper](https://zenodo.org/record/6456380), [other conference paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04289.pdf)). It has been developed as an independant program for quite a while but the development stalled in favour of the new Tidal 2.0 and [Tidal Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/). The original repository [can be found here](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex).

A Vortex prototype is now available for Sardine, and with it, the deep and robust TidalCycles patterning language. Vortex is transparently added to your session as long as your `superdirt_handler` is turned on. You have nothing to do or install.

Some work remains to be done to be on par with the base implementation but I am doing what I can to save this great project. I have included and supported the most critical parts of it by embedding it into Sardine.
