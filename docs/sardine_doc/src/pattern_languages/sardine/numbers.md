# Numbers

The Sardine Pattern Language supports the same number types as Python:
- **integers:** `1`, `5`, `50012`.
- **floating point numbers:** `10.182`, `0.18`, `123.91239`.

All the common mathematical operators are also available:
```python
@swim
def number(p=0.5, i=0):
    print(P('1 1+1 1*2 1/3 1%4 1+(2+(5/2))', i))
    again(number, p=0.5, i=i+1)
```
Parentheses can be used for greater precision in the sequence of operations and to specify priority.
The mathematical operators apply to numbers as well as to lists. You can for instance write an addition between a number and a list,
between two lists, between a number and a note, between a chord and a list, etc..

```python
@swim
def number(p=0.5, i=0):
    print(P('C5 + 12', i))
    print(P('[10 20 30] + 2', i))
    again(number, p=0.5, i=i+1)
```

Many things can be safely considered as numbers such as **notes**. Internally, a **note** is also a number.

## Random numbers

- You can write random numbers by using the word `rand`.
  - `rand` will return a floating point number between `0.0` and `1.0`.
  - `rand` will be casted to an **Integer** depending on the context (*e.g* `sample:r*8`).
  - `rand` and `0.0~1.0` yield a similar result. Two ways to express the same idea.

There are multiple ways to generate randomness using Sardine. Even thoughÂ `rand` is useful, 
using time tokens will yield unpredictible results.

## Patterns out of time

```python
@swim
def outof(p=0.25, i=0):
    D('cp', speed='$%10', i=i)
    again(outof, p=0.25, i=i+1)
```

Timed tokens make good **low frequency oscillators**, **ramps** or oscillating patterns. 
Playing with time tokens using modulos or the `(sin x)`, `(cos x)` or `(tan x)` functions 
is a great way to get generative results out of a predictible sequence:
- fast recursions (low `p`) will increase the sampling rate of time.

You can start to enter into the realm of signal-like patterns that can be particularly good for generating fluid patterns. **Use this to generate fluid patterns.**
