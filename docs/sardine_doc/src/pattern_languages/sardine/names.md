# Names

```python 
@swim
def names(p=0.5, i=0):
    D('bd pluck bd pluck:(2+4)', i=i)
    again(names, p=0.5, i=i+1)
```

You are using names since your first **Sardine** session! A single letter (if it's not already a note name) can be considered as a name.
Be careful! There are a few hidden rules for names. Names can be one letter long but some letters are already taken by some tokens of the
language (such as `rand`). Names cannot begin with a number. It is also forbidden to use any symbol inside your names.

Names can't start with a number. It will cause you problems with playing some default samples. Be warned!
