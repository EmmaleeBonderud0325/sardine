This page will help you to learn how to configure **Sardine**. You will soon figure out that **Sardine** is modular in nature. You can toggle on and off certain features, you can pre-configure many things and fine-tune to be up and ready for your next sessions, etc...

## I - Code Editors

You can use `Sardine` directly from the Python interpreter, typing lines of code one by one in the interpreter. There is nothing wrong about it but you will be pretty limited in what you can do. This is a very infuriating experience! You might also dislike the fact that popups will be printed pretty frequently if you make mistakes. It is sometimes enough to run quick sound/MIDI tests but not much more. **TLDR:** you need a text editor to truly enjoy Sardine!

**Sardine** code can become quite verbose when dealing with complex *swimming* functions. As you might have guessed already, there is no `Sardine` plugin for **VSCode**, **Atom** or any popular code editor **yet**. However, **Sardine** is just Python and *there are great plugins to deal with interactive Python code already*. Here are a few things you can try.

### Vim / Neovim

[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (and by extension [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim)) is the editor I currently use on stage but the target audience is mostly developers, old Unix gurus and command-line users. **Vim** is a modal text editor with multiple modes for editing and jumping around in the source code. It can be extended using plugins and tweaked to your liking. Quite powerful, but it requires some learning to be proficient. The process for working with **Sardine** from **Neovim** is pretty straightforward:

- 1) install the [slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime) plugin.
- 2) split your workspace in two vertical (`:vs`) or horizontal (`:sp`) panes.
- 3) open up a `:terminal` in one of them and run `python3 -m fishery`.
- 4) work in the other one and use `C-cC-c` to send code from one side to the other.

###Â VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful and all-devouring code editor developed by Microsoft. It is the most widely spread code editor out there with millions of users, thousands of plugins and corporate support. **VSCode** is more than capable of handling **Sardine** sessions and there are multiple ways to configure everything for it.

#### The best technique

- 1) install the `Python` support for VSCode (usually proposed whenever you open a Python file).
- 2) open the configuration menu and search for `Python launch args`. Click on `Modify in settings.json`
- 3) write the following:
```json
    "python.terminal.launchArgs": [
        "-m",
        "asyncio"
    ],
```
- 4) You are done!

To start a new **Sardine** session, open any `.py` file and type:
```python3
from sardine import *
```

Press `Shift+Enter` and wait for the new Python terminal to show up. You can now start typing **Sardine** code, you are good to go! You will need to select the code you want to run before sending it to the console.

Note that simply opening `fishery` in an integrated terminal might be enough since `v.0.2.1`!

#### The Jupyter route

If you like it, you can also use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) extension for working with Python notebooks. Maybe it'll remind you about your daily job or your research at the lab. Whatever!

- install **VSCode** and the **Jupyter Notebook** plugin. To do so, open the Extensions pane on the left (it looks like crates) and search for the extension name. Click install and wait a moment.
- Create a new `.ipynb` notebook either by yourself or by using the plugin-backed command.
- Make sure that you are using **the right Python version** as your kernel (3.10).
- run:
    ```python
      import sys;
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install "/path/to/sardine"
    ```
- restart the kernel and run:
    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/sardine')
    from sardine import *
    ```
From now on, **Sardine** is installed in the notebook you just created. You can write cells containing your **Sardine** code, which makes it easy to work with. Some plugins allow you to write and manage cells directly using source code, using symbols akin to comment strings. More on this later!

### Emacs

The venerable [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is of course able to manage Sardine! Please use the [python.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/python.el) plugin. This mode will allow you to pipe easily your code from a text buffer to a running interpeter. The plugin is adding quality-of-life features for working with **Python** in general but also makes working with a **REPL** much easier and much more convenient. If you are new to the vast world of Emacs, it is probably worthwhile to take a look at [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) or [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/), both being really great distributions of plugins. I will not dive into more details, as Emacs users are generally able to figure out their prefered way of working by themselves :)

## II - Configuration options

**Sardine** is relying on a configuration folder that will be silently created the first time you open it. The path leading to the configuration folder can be printed out by typing `print_config()`. This command will also print out the content of your main configuration file. How practical! 

There are three files you can tweak to configure **Sardine**:

- `config.json`: main **Sardine** configuration file.
- `default_superdirt.scd`: **SuperDirt** configuration file.
- `user_configuration.py`: Python code runned everytime you boot **Sardine** (facultative).

There is also a `synths` folder made to store synthesis definitions (synthesizers, effects).

- `synths` folder: store new synthesizers written with **SuperCollider**, usually one synth per `.scd file`.

### A - Sardine

The `config.json` file will allow you to finetune **Sardine** by choosing a default MIDI port, a default PPQN (*pulses per quarter note*, used for the MIDI Clock), and BPM (*beats per minute*), etc... You can edit it manually but you don't have too. There is a tool made for that, installed by default on your `$PATH`. Access it by typing `sardine-config`.

![Configuration tool](images/configuration_screen.png)

**Sardine** can generate its own MIDI port which is very convenient if you don't have any virtual MIDI port ready to be hijacked. This feature however is limited to MacOS/Linux.

Here is a rundown of what each option is doing in the config file:

| Syntax      | Description |
| -----------: | :----------- |
|`beats`| Number of beats per bar |
|`boot_supercollider`| Booting SuperCollider subprocess or not |
|`bpm`| Default beats per minute (tempo) when starting a session |
|`debug`| Used by devs |
|`deferred_scheduling`| Important option for the scheduling mechanism |
|`link_clock`| Should Sardine start a Link clock for synchronisation? |
|`midi`| Default MIDI output used by Sardine |
|`parser`| For future versions, choosing a parser version |
|`sardine_boot_file`| Where the boot file is currently located |
|`superdirt_config_path`| Where the internal SuperDirt configuration is located |
|`superdirt_handler`| Should Sardine add an option to trigger SuperDirt? |
|`user_config_path`| Configuration path for running arbitrary code |
|`verbose_superdirt`| Mirroring SuperCollider output in the terminal |

### B - SuperDirt

The `default_superdirt.scd` is... your default `SuperDirt` configuration. You must edit it manually if you are willing to load more audio samples, change your audio outputs or add anything that you need on the **SuperCollider** side. The `synths` folder is a repository for your `SynthDefs` file. Each synthesizer should be saved in its own file and will be loaded automatically at boot time. 

!!! important "How to tweak the SuperDirt file"
	The [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt) repository is a good place to start, especially the `hacks/` folder that will teach you how to edit and configure *SuperDirt* to your liking. **SuperDirt** was initially conceived for TidalCycles, and there is more documentation about Tidal and its usage than documentation about anything **Sardine**.

!!! note "Editing the SuperDirt file directly from the terminal"
	If you know how to work with text files from the terminal using `vim` or `nano`, there is a command available to open the default *SuperDirt* configuration file: `sardine-config-superdirt`. It will open up the file using `$EDITOR`. Be sure to configure it beforehand!

Here is an example showing of how to load more audio samples to play with:

```supercollider
(
s.reboot {
	s.options.numBuffers = 1024 * 256;
	s.options.memSize = 8192 * 32;
	s.options.numWireBufs = 128;
	s.options.maxNodes = 1024 * 32;
	s.options.numOutputBusChannels = 2;
	s.options.numInputBusChannels = 2;
	s.waitForBoot {
		~dirt = SuperDirt(2, s);
		~dirt.loadSoundFiles;
		~dirt.loadSoundFiles("/Users/bubo/Dropbox/MUSIQUE/LIVE_SMC/DRUMS/*");
		s.sync;
		~dirt.start(57120, 0 ! 12);
		(
			~d1 = ~dirt.orbits[0]; ~d2 = ~dirt.orbits[1]; ~d3 = ~dirt.orbits[2];
			~d4 = ~dirt.orbits[3]; ~d5 = ~dirt.orbits[4]; ~d6 = ~dirt.orbits[5];
			~d7 = ~dirt.orbits[6]; ~d8 = ~dirt.orbits[7]; ~d9 = ~dirt.orbits[8];
			~d10 = ~dirt.orbits[9]; ~d11 = ~dirt.orbits[10]; ~d12 = ~dirt.orbits[11];
		);
	};
	s.latency = 0.3;
};
)
```

!!! tip "How to include a new sample folder"

    SuperDirt treats a wildcard (`*`) at the end of the path to mean that there are named subdirectories. If you want to load just one sample directory, omit the wildcard.

Many people already use the **SuperDirt** audio backend for live-coding, more specifically people working with [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org). You will find a lot of configuration tips, tools and extensions by searching in the TOPLAP / Tidal communities forums and chats.

### C - Python

The last configuration file is named `user_configuration.py`. It is not created by default. It must be added manually if you wish to use this feature. All the code placed in this file will be imported by default everytime you boot **Sardine**. It is an incredibely useful feature to automate some things:

* functions, aliases, classes, **OSC** and **MIDI** connexions.
* Starting some musical code, aka 'art installation' mode for museums, openings, etc... You will be able to manually take over after init if you ever wished to change parameters.

!!! warning "Do not break Sardine"
	Make sure not to override any of the defaults. This file will run **after** init, and can override basic Sardine functionalities if you are not careful enough.
