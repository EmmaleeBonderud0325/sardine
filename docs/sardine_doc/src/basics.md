# Basics

This part functions like a reference documentation for the main components used with Sardine. When you are learning, you won't need to understand everything in each page. But later, these pages will be the go-to source for how things works and what syntax to use. 

Some sections will cover concepts like temporal recursion or randomizing iterations. We try to keep the technical jargon to a minimum but sometimes it's important to understand more about what is happening. 

Components and features covered in Basics:
- **Senders:** everything you do in Sardine builds from Senders. We cover all the syntax options for samples, MIDI, Ziffers, etc in both Play and @swim functions. 
- **@swim functions:** the fundamental mechanism for organizing patterns.
- **Players:** shorthand syntax and the most basic way to create patterns. 
- **Iterator** (@swim function)
- **Period, Divisor, Rate:** used for controlling rhythm and repetition.
- **Tempo and playback control**
