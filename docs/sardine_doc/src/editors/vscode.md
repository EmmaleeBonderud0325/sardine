[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful and all-devouring code editor developed by ****Microsoft****. It is the most widely spread code editor out there with millions of users, thousands of plugins and corporate support. **VSCode** is more than capable of handling **Sardine** sessions and there are multiple ways to configure everything for it.

You can find a package called `sardine` in the Extensions marketplace for `VSCode` and `VSCodium`: 
- click on the Extensions Tab on the left panel
- Search for `Sardine` (currently `v.0.0.2`)
- install and read the instructions :)
