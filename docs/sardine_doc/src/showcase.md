# Showcase
The Showcase section has examples of live coding using Sardine. It includes Algoraves, Solstice streams, experimental electronic music, and Sardine with graphics. 

Anyone using Sardine can submit their work to include in the Showcase. The best way is to submit a pull request, but you can also reach out to Bubo in the Sardine Discord channel for help. 

Guidelines:  
- Made using Sardine or involves Sardine
- Recording available to share (YouTube, Vimeo, Bandcamp, etc )
- Code available to share (GitHub, or we can include it here)
- Any styles, any genres, etc.
- Doesn't have to be a fully polished performance
