# Pattern Languages

Sardine comes out of the box with three pattern languages for you to play with :
- **Sardine Pattern Language:** the default pattern language used everywhere.
- **Ziffers:** a pattern language specialised in writing chords and melodies.
- **Vortex:** a Python port of the [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) patterning language.

It is up to you to know if you'd prefer to use one or the other. They are both
very capable but one of them might be more suitable for certain tasks. **Ziffers**
is generally more terse and easier to use for melodic writing. The **SPL** is 
good at generating data patterns and interesting pattern transformations.
