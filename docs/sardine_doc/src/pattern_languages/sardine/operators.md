# Operators

**Python** is limited to a set of operators and you can't create your own. That's not good for us because live coding
is also about speed. It is faster to write `!!` than to write `repeat_and_copy`. That&rsquo;s also why having a
**pattern language** is important. We have new operators to work with to create musical patterns.
