# Text Editors

Text editors are particularly important to get the most out of **Sardine**. Remember that this is a tool for **live coding** and that you will need to setup everything to feel comfortable. **Sardine** can support most text editors and IDEs. I have been using **Sardine** using **Vim**, **Neovim**, **Emacs**, **VSCode** and of course&#x2026; the integrated text editor. This editor is provided mostly for workshops and demos. If you are planning for a gig or anything serious, please consider using and learning a real text editor.
