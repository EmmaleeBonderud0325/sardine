# Post installation

You managed to install Sardine. Congratulations.

- **Windows users:** check if SuperCollider is properly detected.
  - if not, boot SuperCollider and Sardine side by side. Check the configuration 
    section and the troubleshot section to learn more about this.
- **Everyone:** if you are installing from the main branch on GitHub, you will need
  to build Fishery Web yourself to use it! Check out the Fishery Web page to learn more
  about this process.
