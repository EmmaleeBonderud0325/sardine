**SuperDirt** documentation is rather scarce and most of it needs to be inferred by looking at the source code. However, the behavior of most parameters is well known &#x2013; usually from experience &#x2013; by live coders. Moreover, **SuperDirt** can be customised freely to add custom effects and synthesizers. I&rsquo;m working hard on gathering information about each and every parameter I can find :) Some of them are rather arcane. They are probably not meant to be used directly. Keep in mind that not all of them are useful and that you will likely find better options by building your own environment.
