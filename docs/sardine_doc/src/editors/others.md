# Others

In the past, people have been running **Sardine** code on many different text editors and platforms:

-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org): a very popular framework for using **Python** in data sciences, machine learning, etc.
-   [Atom](https://github.com/atom) (**depracated**) / [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/): killed by **Microsoft**, was once a very nice but slow text editor/IDE.

We know this is working, but there is no documentation about it or the one we have is outdated!
