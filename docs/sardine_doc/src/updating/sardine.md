# Sardine

This section is about fixing errors when running the `sardine` command. `sardine` is Sardine's playing environment that you fire up just like any other Python REPL (*Read Eval Print Loop*).

## UVLoop is not installed

UVLoop is not available on Windows. If you are running Windows, this message will pop-up everytime
you start Sardine. Don't worry too much about it!

## The `d` or `D` objects are not found

* Make sure that you turned on `SuperDirt Handlers` in `sardine config`.
