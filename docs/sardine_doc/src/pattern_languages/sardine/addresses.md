# Addresses

```python
O("an/address another/address", value=1, other_value=2)
```
- Addresses are just like names except that they can contain a \`/\` separator just like any other typical OSC address.
- They are not really distinct from a name. The difference is only conceptual.

Be careful, some functions might still require you to write addresses using a `/` first. Check twice.
