# Operators

**Python** is limited to a set of operators and you can't even create your own. Operators are great for typing speed **Sardine** is a live coding library. It is faster to write `!!` than to use a function named `repeat_and_copy`. That's why having a **pattern language** is important:
- new operators to work on lists and note collections, very common in a musical context.
- new behavior for well known operators such as the addition, the multiplication, etc...
- new operators for working on custom objects : sample names, addresses, etc...
