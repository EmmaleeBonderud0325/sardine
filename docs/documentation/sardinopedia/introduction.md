The **Sardinopedia** is a growing and ordered collection of **Sardine** patterns. They are usually sorted in sections, showcasing various features of the system. Patterns worthy of inclusion in the **Sardinopedia** must at least have one of the following qualities:

- **they are demonstrative**: they highlight a particular feature.

- **they are didactic**: they teach you how to use **Sardine**.

- **they are musical**: they have an interesting musical result.

- **they are odd**: they show something odd, unexpected, funny, etc...

Some sections can be really verbose. They will contain explanations about usage of the system. As such, the **Sardinopedia** is your main source of documentation concerning **Sardine**. This documentation is entirely written by the community. Feel free to contribute by altering what is found in the `docs/`Â folder and to add whatever you see fit! There are some areas where the Sardinopedia is a bit lacking!
