**Sardine** is an instrument/tool that you control by programming live. Your keyboard will be your main musical interface, which is pretty unusual compared to other musical practices. **Sardine** is a tool made to explore various live coding techniques, and a tool made to integrate with other live coding softwares and environments. For people unfamiliar with it, live coding can be said to be three things at once:

-   **a programming technique:** the art of manipulating, redefining or altering software while it runs. A technique exploring processes of hot swapping, reloading or re-compiling parts of a software stack without interruption, as part of the way the software is meant to be used.
-   **an artistic practice:** promoting artistic expression throughout the use of computer code. Turning programming into a gestural and expressive act, usually meant to be shared with an audience.
-   **a subculture:** a niche in the larger world of computer and electronic music. Live coding has always been there. You can trace its origins way back to the 70s if you are really looking for it :) Nowadays, live coding is mostly promoted by algoravers or by the [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org/) collective.

Try to read about it. It's a fascinating world of people happily hacking and sharing software, usually free and open source. The goal is to find the right tool for the nail you want to hammer, and build from there, turning your computer into an environment for personal artistic expression. For our case, it means that Sardine is meant to be extended, modified, specialised for what you need to do :)
