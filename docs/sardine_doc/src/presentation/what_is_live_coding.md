Sardine offers a different approach to musical creativity by allowing you to control the instrument through live programming. 
Your keyboard becomes your primary musical interface, a refreshing departure from traditional musical practices. Sardine is
designed to explore various live coding techniques and seamlessly integrate with other live coding software and environments.

For those new to the concept, live coding embodies three distinct aspects:
1. **A programming technique**: Live coding involves manipulating, redefining, or altering software while it's running. This approach
   explores hot swapping, reloading, or re-compiling parts of a software stack without interruption, as an integral part of the software's
   intended usage.
2. **An artistic practice**: Live coding encourages artistic expression through the use of computer code. It transforms programming into a
   gestural and expressive act, typically shared with an audience to create a more immersive experience.
3. **A subculture**: Live coding represents a niche within the broader landscape of computer and electronic music. Its roots can be traced
   back to the 1970s, and today, it is primarily championed by algoravers and the TOPLAP collective.


The world of live coding is a fascinating realm of passionate individuals hacking and sharing software, typically with a focus on free and
open-source resources. The objective is to find the right tool for your specific creative goals and build a personalized artistic environment
on your computer.

Try to read about it. It's a fascinating world of people happily hacking and sharing software, usually free and open source. The goal is to find the right tool for the nail you want to hammer, and build from there, turning your computer into an environment for personal artistic expression. For our case, it means that Sardine is meant to be extended, modified, specialised for what you need to do :)
