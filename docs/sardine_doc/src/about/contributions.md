# Contributions

Contributions of any sort are really welcome! I am not a professional developer and am just trying
to do my best with **Sardine**! I might code things in a weird or unefficient way. Everything takes
place on the main [GitHub](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/sardine) repo. Don't be afraid
about proposing breaking changes or to take a different direction from mine! It can be a fun adventure.
