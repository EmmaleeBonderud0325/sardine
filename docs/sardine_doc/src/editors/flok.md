# Flok

**Sardine** has been integrated to [Flok](https://github.com/munshkr/flok), a collaborative text editor for live coding. Using `Flok`, you can easily share a **Sardine** session with other musicians and visualists. `Flok` **is not an online version of Sardine**. You will still need to install it locally to have sound. However, if you are playing together with some friends in a single room, one only needs to have **Sardine** installed and active! To use `Flok`, follow the following instructions:

-   Install [Flok](https://github.com/munshkr/flok) on your computer if you want to use the audio backend (**Sardine** itself)!
-   Go to [flok.cc](https://flok.cc) or [sardine.doesnotexist](https://sardine.doesnotexist.club) and create a new session by following the prompt.
-   Share the session link with your friends. Use the command to connect your `REPL` to the session.
-   Have fun!

**To be 100% sure that everything will work perfectly, please use **Firefox**. **Chrome** has been reported not to work well with **MacOS**.**
