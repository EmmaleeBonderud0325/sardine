# Installation

**Ziffers** is not activated by default when you first boot `fishery`. It is currently shipped independently
from Sardine. Ziffers is easy to install in a few basic steps:
1) Download or clone the source from GitHub:
   - `git clone https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/ziffers-python`
2) Install `ziffers-python` as a package for your Python environment:
   -Â `cd ziffers-python && python -m pip install .`

That's it! It should get rid of the messages telling you that Ziffers is not installed.
